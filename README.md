# Physics Simulation

## [The Running Simulation](http://wmelton12.github.io/PhysSims)

I am learning about d3 and javascript/coffeescript and I wrote this to practice using these tools. 

The simulation is a ball bouncing around in a 2d plane.  It displays the vector which describes its velocity and the magnitude of that vector in graphs to the right.

Clicking the red box on the bottom will add a vectorInputter to the page.  Click a vectorInput will change the vector for that vectorInputer.  All of these vectors are added as forces.

The project is written in Coffeescript

Here's a link to the wiki, where you can see how the project is structured and the classes involved:
